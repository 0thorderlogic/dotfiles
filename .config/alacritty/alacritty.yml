# You’re running on Wayland. The problem is that Gnome requires all Wayland apps to draw their own window decorations, and what you’re seeing is Alacritty’s homebrew attempt at a title bar. Alacritty does this for performance reasons - if it draws its own decorations, then it doesn’t have to rely on pulling in GTK or another widget library to draw them and likely slowing it down.

# The fix is to run Alacritty using an Xwayland instance. From your gnome terminal, run the command:

# env -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY alacritty

# If this works, you’re now running alacritty using Xorg instead of Wayland. You may encounter some weirdness such as clipboard cut-and-paste failures - Xwayland had issues with this in the past and I don’t know if they’ve been ironed out yet (or if that’s even possible).

# If you don’t want to run alacritty using Xwayland, then unfortunately you’ll need to live with mismatched title bars or choose another terminal.
# env -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY alacritty
